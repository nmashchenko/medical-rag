( examples of these overlooked regions might be micro tumors in other parts of an organ that may not , in themselves , have a highly significant effect on the supervised decision boundary2 ; it has been shown , especially for medical imaging dnns , that such models typically disregard a significant fraction of these regions , which are essentially background evidence in relation to the underlying pathological condition23 ) . however , gans , while powerful , have faults that have led to the very recent development of a new state - of - the - art generative mechanism : visual diffusion . diffusion models are typically able to operate at higher resolutions and image qualities than gans . they are also superior to gans in not suffering from mode collapse arising from the adversarial process of distinguishing real from generated images reaching a convergence ( nash equilibrium ) in which critical image classes are omitted24 . diffusion models have been used for counterfactual generation as diff - scm21 , and similar192526 . in this work , we shall use visual diffusion for counterpart normal generation . our approach hence uses counterfactual generation with diffusion models directed at visual attribution in the medical imaging domain in a manner that builds on the conceptual foundations of generative visual attribution laid out in vant"

( 2018 ) demonstrated the synthesis of flair images from t1 modality for segmentation tasks . similarly , the heteromodal variational encoder - decoder framework proposed by dorent et al . ( 2019 ) performs joint modality completion and segmentation , generating the required modality . another approach focuses on learning modality - invariant feature spaces . the method by havaei et al .

    "text": ". firstly , we extract the features of each domain ( or pseudo domain using clustering ) from our training set isic2019 , and we also extract the features from a target dataset , derm7pt - clinc . using these extracted features , we calculate the frechet distance [ 50 ] between each domain and the target dataset , which represents the domain distance between them . next , we record the learned weights of each domain prompt . when domain labels are available , we observe that our model assigns the highest weight to the dark corner group , as the domain distance between the dark corner group and the derm7pt - clin dataset is the closest , as shown in the right panel of fig . 5(a ) . this indicates that the dark corner group shares the most similar domain information with the target dataset , and thus , it is given the highest weight . on the other hand , the clean group is assigned the smallest weight , as the domain distance between the clean group and the target dataset is the largest . this suggests that the domains of the clean group are significantly different from the target domain and contain less useful information for target domain prediction . a similar relationship can be observed when our model uses pseudo domain labels , as shown in fig.5.b . in both cases , there is a negative correlation between the domain distance and the corresponding prompts weights . this implies that our model can precisely learn the relevant knowledge from different domains and assign higher weights to the domains that are more similar to the target domain . e. clustering analysis our method acquires pseudo domain labels via one - time clustering . one concern is whether the clustering is performed based on category labels rather than visual domains . to inves- tigate this , we evaluated the correlation between the category labels and the pseudo domain labels . the results , shown in the blue lines in fig . 6 , indicate the normalized mutual information ( nmi ) between them at different layers ( 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 ) of the vit . a high nmi value suggests a strong correlation . we observed that the correlation between pseudo domain labels \n debiasing evaluation on trap set consisting of six skin datasets with different bias levels . and category labels is high in the last layer ( l12 ) of the vit but low in the shallow layer ( l1 ) . this indicates that the clustering was not performed based on category labels when selecting the cls token from the shallow layer ( l1 ) . furthermore , we noticed that the nmi between pseudo domain labels and their previous assignments became stable after a few epochs in layer 1 . based on these observations , we chose to cluster the cls token from the later 1 in"

[ 51 ] showed that the use of pre - defined domain labels in original datasets is not necessary , given that the domain labels in many well- known domain generalization datasets are sub - optimal , we are still curious about how our method clusters the samples . to gain further insights , we visualize the cls token features in layer 1 for the skin dataset using t - sne in fig . 7 . it reveals that the pseudo domain labels are still based on style features , with clusters representing ink marking , dark corner , dark skin , and light skin . this aligns with observations from the dermatology literature [ 3 ] , [ 52 ] . f. trap set debiasing in fig . 8 , we compare the performance of the erm baseline , our method using domain labels ( epvt ) , and our method without domain labels ( pldg ) on six biased trap datasets . each point on the graph represents an algorithm trained and tested on a specific bias degree split of the trap set . the graph illustrates that the erm baseline outperforms our pldg when the bias degree is low ( 0 and 0.3 ) . however , this can be attributed to the fact that erm heavily relies on spurious correlations between artifacts and class labels , leading to overfitting the training set . as the bias degree increases , the correlation between artifacts and class labels decreases , and relying solely on artifacts for prediction becomes unreliable . this causes the performance of erm to drop dramatically on the test set with a significant distribution difference . in contrast , our pldg shows greater robustness to different bias levels . notably , our pldg outperforms the erm baseline by 6.13 % on the bias 1 dataset . although epvt exhibits greater robustness than our pldg , it is important to note that pldg is more general for debiasing as it does not require domain labels for the dataset , making it applicable in real - world scenarios where domain labels are unavailable or noisy . v. conclusion in this paper , we introduce a latent domain generalization method for medical image classification , and we try to answer"

[ 7 ] provides a review of approaches to cancer treatment focused on medical decision support . in the context of drug design for cancer treatment , ( deep ) reinforcement learning ( rl ) approaches have been proposed recently [ 33,34 ] , but with the disadvantage of being black - box approaches , preventing the practitioner from access to an explainable model of disease evolution and treatment . uncertainty quantification in models of assisted decision making have been proposed to alleviate this problem [ 4 ] . in the same line of work , [ 5 ] advocate learning of mechanistic models of cancer evolution / treatment in order to help decision making . however , the latter approach requires a large amount of data prior to applying any treatment action , in order to learn a model that may prove only partially valid as decisions influence the disease dynamics . the authors advocate that the approach may be rendered more efficient if learning phases are interleaved with actual decision phases . \n an alternative view of controlled pdmps controlled pdmps can be modelled as continuous space pomdps , in the way we proposed in this paper . however , they can also be seen as a particular subclass of continuous - time ( partially observed ) semi - markov decision processes [ 23 ] . fully - observed continuous - time semi - markov decision processes extend markov decision processes by including random continuous durations of state transitions and by considering that decisions can only be made at transition times . several reinforcement learning solution approaches have been proposed , both in the fully - observed [ 8,19 ] and partially - observed [ 20 ] cases to solve these problems . an alternative approach to ours could be to cast the pdmp model of cancer treatment into the continuous - time smdp model and look for specializations of the existing simulation based solution algorithms . 5.2 supplementary simulation results on pomcp parameters here we provide raw results for a series of parameter we tried to tune to optimize the pomcp algorithm , but that did not seem to bring additional improvement in our framework . table 4 shows the impact of the trade off parameter   in a few scenarios for the particle filter . set , n = 500 trajectories were simulated . the value column is the average cost of the trajectories over the n trajectories , and   its empirical variance"

    "text": ", grl meth- ods were seldom applied to medical report generation due to the two drawbacks that we identified above . recently , medvill [ 20 ] applied grl framework to medical report generation ( as one of the downstream tasks ) by progres- sively replacing mask tokens with predicted language to- kens . unfortunately , its performance was limited ( 0.066 in bleu4 in the mimic - cxr dataset ) as it was not trained to handle situations where text information is not available . in contrast , our proposed framework differs in several key aspects : i ) grl methods are typically designed for pre - training on large datasets followed by fine - tuning for specific tasks , whereas our framework is trained end - to - end and can be directly applied to medical report generation ; ii ) grl usually employs a fixed mask ratio , but we utilize a dy- namic mask ratio ; and iii ) while conventional methods pri- oritize morphological similarity , our approach emphasizes semantic similarity . 3 . method 3.1 . network architecture dtrace consists of five key components : a visual en- coder , a visual decoder , a linguistic encoder , a linguistic de- coder , and a cross - modal fusion module ( fig . 3 ) . the visual encoder processes partially masked images to extract in- complete pathological information . simultaneously , the lin- guistic encoder also processes fragmented textual informa- tion to extract incomplete pathological information . then , the extracted information is fed into the cross - modal fusion module , where a cross - attention mechanism is employed to foster the interaction between the visual and linguistic do- mains , thereby ameliorating the semantic deficits in both \n cardiac contour normal . cardiac contour normal . visual encoder cls mlp linguistic encoder cls mlp cross - modal prototype q&r cross - modal attention cross - modal fusion linguistic decoder token visual decoder cardiac contour normal . the is modalities . after this , the enriched information is conveyed to the visual and linguistic decoders to restore the masked images and reports to their original unmasked states . below , we discuss the key components of dtrace in detail : visual encoder is consistent with the common prac- tice of mae ; medical images were split into patches and then randomly masked . the visual encoder was a standard vit [ 7 ] , which mapped the unmasked patches into latent representations and then performed multi - label classification to predict the disease labels extracted via chexbert [ 24 ] . in linguistic encoder , medical reports were mapped into embedded text tokens following the stan- dard pre - processing steps [ 6 ] . then , these tokens were ran- domly masked and fed into the linguistic encoder . the lin- guistic encoder was a classic text transformer block [ 29 ] . for the cross - modal fusion module ,"

    "text": ", the physicians statement asserts that combining buspar and zoloft may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome , while , on the other hand , the model claims that there are no known major interactions between buspar and zoloft . this contradiction can impact the patients medication intake . we note that finding cause of error in such cases is hard , and physicians are also prone to making dangerous errors . this particular error can be attributed to a combination of miss- ing information within publicly available medical sources and by the llm assuming that their omis- sion implies the drug combination is safe . for the gpt models in our evaluation , it seems that larger models lead to improved comprehen- siveness ... in table 4 , we observe that gpt-4 outperforms gpt-3.5 under every comparable set- ting . these findings align with those of roberts et al . ( 2020 ) , who demonstrated , in the task of open- domain question answering , that the capability of a pretrained model to answer questions without access to any external knowledge scales with the models size . ... yet the larger the gpt model , the more it seems to introduce new hallucinations . revis- iting table 4 , we see that the improved compre- hensiveness comes at the cost of an increase in the hallucination rate . domain - specific rag reduces hallucinations . among all configurations , gpt-3.5+icl+rag demonstrates the fewest hallucinations while main- taining a comparatively good comprehensiveness score . upon close examination , we found that the tradeoff with comprehensiveness is partly due to its tendency to abstain from answering in certain questions ( see % respond column in table 5 ) . we model use search # words medalpaca 7b   48.6 mistral 7b   68.4 palm-2   80.0 bard   242.1 bing chat   95.7 gpt-3.5   60.8 gpt-3.5+icl   80.3 gpt-3.5+rag   96.3 gpt-3.5+icl+rag   173.2 gpt-4   63.1 gpt-4+icl   132.8 gpt-4+rag   89.8 gpt-4+icl+rag   130.1 models . # words represents the average number of words in a response note that this may actually be desired over mis- information in a patient - facing application . for this model , when computing the metrics only over the answered questions , it receives a comp score of 65.5 % and a hall score of 16.1 , which is still the lowest in hallucinations but with the second- highest comprehensiveness . however , bing chat and bard , which also abstain occasionally ( e.g. , i m unable to help , as i am only a language model and do nt have the ability to process and under- stand that . ) , appear to underperform compared to their base models , even though they use some vari- ants of gpt and palm . this discrepancy might stem from our prompts lacking task optimization and their generic web retrieval , especially failing to focus on consumer health inquiries in the medical"

    "text": ") , appear to underperform compared to their base models , even though they use some vari- ants of gpt and palm . this discrepancy might stem from our prompts lacking task optimization and their generic web retrieval , especially failing to focus on consumer health inquiries in the medical domain from reliable sources . medalpaca performs poorly on k - qa . even though medalpaca was fine - tuned specifically for the biomedical domain and intended for use as medical conversational ai , it exhibites the poorest results on both metrics , with an especially high hal- lucination rate . these findings indicate a mismatch between closed - qa ( e.g. , medical exams and short answers ) and real - world patient questions which require the generation of long medical answers . conclusion in this work , we introduce k - qa , a question- answering benchmark that includes real - world pa- tients questions and carefully curated fine - grained \n answers by physicians . in addition , we formu- late metrics that quantify how well a predicted answer covers important information and to what extent it contradicts gold answers . our evaluation shows that while models improve with size and augmented generation , there is still a lot of room for improvement , especially in the comprehensive- ness of the answers and ensuring that they do not include medically inaccurate statements . ethics statement the data in k - qa originates from deidentified real- world patient conversations that have been man- ually reviewed to ensure there are no leaks . in particular , we verified that the questions do not dis- close any private medical information , and revolve around general medical questions . the answers in k - qa were manually written by medical doctors , who did not use any automated writing assistance and wrote their answers with a general audience in mind . our legal team has reviewed and approved the methodology used . limitations one of the major limitations of our evaluation ap- proach is its reliance on llms for approximating the entailment relation between ground - truth and predicted answers . while this was done in various recent works , it may propagate noise into the evalu- ation process , and yield a costly evaluation protocol . to mitigate this concern , we measure the agreement between human annotators and predicted labels , finding overall good agreement , while reducing evaluation costs an important avenue for future work ( perlitz et al . , 2023 ) . acknowledgments we would like to express our gratitude to carmel vider , lee herzog , tamar brufman , nadia mor- denfeld , lior hayat , ohad simons , jessica thien , shira ben porat , itay omer , assaf frajman , and noa bleistein for curating and reviewing the med- ical answers . in addition , we would like to thank nadav rabani and yaara arkin for insightful dis- cussion that influenced the direction"
